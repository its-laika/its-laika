## About

Hi. ‚úåüèª   
I'm Laika, a web developer from the Lower Rhine region in Germany.
At my job I work on an Angular project and a "grown-up" PHP backend.
I also gained some knowledge of Docker and basic server administration during work as well. 
Off-work I really like to play around with Rust and Linux.

## Languages, stacks and tools
#### Proficient
- C# / .NET (3+), EF Core and xUnit
- ECMAScript
- Git and Git flow
- PHP (7+) and PHPUnit
- Relational databases like MariaDB, Postgres

#### Basic to advanced knowledge (depends on who you're asking)
- Angular
- Docker
- Rust
- Server management and configuration (e.g. nginx, ssh, fail2ban, ufw, docker compose)

## Projects
My GitHub projects are mostly created for personal use and therefore aren't always in active development or even production-ready.
I try to update them now and then to keep them usable.
If you want to use one of them or need an extension, feel free to create an issue or fork them directly.

#### License
The projects are usually licensed under the MIT license.
This means you can basically do whatever you want with the code but I can't be liable if things go south.

## Any questions?
Write me an email!
